### research background

During and after my MSc graduation in 1983 at Delft University of Technology I worked on the formulation and implementation of Flexible Multibody Dynamics. This resulted, among other things, in a computer code SPACAR, software for dynamic analysis of flexible multibody systems.

I always have been interesting in dynamical systems with rolling contacts, and I developed, already at an early stage in my career, an extension of the analysis of multibody dynamics systems having idealized rolling contact, the so-called non-holonomic systems. I implemented the idealized rolling contact model in the computer code SPACAR.

During my sabbatical stay in 2001 at Cornell University with Andy Ruina I came into contact with bicycle dynamics. The base for this was already laid out by Jim Papadopoulos in the 70's at Cornell but after Jim left nothing much happened. I picked up the subject and together with Andy Ruina, Jim Papadopoulos and Jaap Meijaard, we wrote on the history of bicycle steer and dynamics equations and the definite benchmark paper on the lateral dynamics of the bicycle.

The last twenty year of my career at Delft University of Technology I worked on applications of the dynamics and control of the bicycle. Where for the last ten years I focused on cycling safety because of the still yearly rise in cycling injured and death. In particular, I focused on the role of the dynamics and control of the mainly lateral unstable bicycle by including the man-in-the-loop.
