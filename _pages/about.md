title: About me

Hey, I am Sam. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Leiden, where I research histones in prokaryotes.
Histones are small proteins that bind to DNA. They are well known to form nucleosome structures in humans and other eukaryotes.
However, not much is known about histones in prokaryotes, which is why I am looking at them.
Besides looking at natural proteins, I have an interest in de novo protein design.

My hobbies include programming, sailing, board- and videogames, photography, reading books, and watching films.
