I'm in  theoretical and applied mechanics and I have been teaching mechanics and multibody dynamics. I am interested in Dynamics of Mechanical Systems, the so-called Multibody Dynamics. In particular the treatment of contact phenomena like in collisions and rolling (non-holonomic constraints) have my special interest. I also know more or less about dynamics of flexible multibody system, finite element method, legged locomotion, speed skating and bicycle dynamics and control. My degrees are from Engineering at Dordrecht (BSc 79) and Engineering at Delft (MSc 83, PhD 02).


I'm now a professor emiritus from Delft University of Technology, department of Mechanical Engineering, Biomechanical Engineering. I started the TUDelft bicycle lab in 2002, after my return from a sabbatical year at Cornell University with [Andy Ruina](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Since my official retirment in 2021, the [TUDelft Bicycle Laboratorium](https://mechmotum.github.io/){:target="_blank"} is run by Jason Moore.
